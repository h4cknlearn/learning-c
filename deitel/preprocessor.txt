in CS, preprocessor or precompiler is a program that process its input data to produce output that is used as input to another program

the output is said to be a preprocessed form of the input data, which is often used by some subsequent programs like compilers


------> a common example from computer programming is the processing performed on source code before the next step of compilation

in some languages, e.g -- C -- there is a phase of translation known as preprocessing. It can also include macro processing, file inclusion and language extensions.
