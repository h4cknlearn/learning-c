the solution to any computing problem involves executing a series of actions in a specific order


a procedure for solving a problem in terms of
1 ---- the actions to be executed
2 ---- the order in which these actions are to be executed

is called an algorithm.

control structures

structured programming !== goto elimination

jacopini and bohm
-> all programs could be written in terms of only
three control structures

1. sequence structure
2. selection structure
- if: single selection statement
- if else: double selection statement
- switch: multiple selection statement

3. iteration structure
- while
- do while
- for

control statement stacking
control statement nesting

Any C program can be constructed from only 7 different types of control
statements combined in only 2 ways.
----> this is the essence of simplicity.

conditional operator
Cs only ternary operator -- it takes three operands

1. condition
2. value for the entire conditional expression if it is true
value for the enire conditional expression if it is false

ex puts(grade >= 60 ? "passed" : "failed");

ex grade >= 60 ? puts("passed") : puts("failed");
if grade is greater than or equal to 60, then puts("passed"), otherwise puts("failed")

conditional operators can be used in places where if else statements cannot
including expressions and arguments to functions like printf;
