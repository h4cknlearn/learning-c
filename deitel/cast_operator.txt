average = ( float ) total / counter;

dividing 2 integer results in integer division in which any fractional
part of the calculation is truncated (lost).

because the calculation is performed first, the fractional part is lost before the result is assigned to average.

to produce a floating point calculation with integer values, we must create temporary values that are floating point numbers

C provides the unary cast operator to accomplish this task
average = ( float ) total / counter;

formatting floating point numbers

converion specifier %.2f 
f: specifies that a floating point value will be printed
.2: is the precision with which the value will be diplayed - with 2 digits
to the right of the decimal point


PS -- using precision in a conversion specification in the format control string of a scanf statement is an error
----> precisions are used only in printf conversion specifications
